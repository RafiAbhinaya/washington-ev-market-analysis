## **Background**
Electric Vehicles (EV) are taking over the otomotive industry, and according to various sources, The United States of America has the second biggest EV market, just behind China. One of the leading states for the EV market share in the US is the Washington State. According to [Clean Technica](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/14/top-us-states-for-ev-market-share-13-states-with-10-ev-share/), Washington holds the third place of the highest EV market share with 24.6%. In 2024, the Washington state EV market saw a significant increase in EV sales and registrations.

For EV companies, Washington State is prime target for sales and expansion. In this project, I analyzed the Washington State Electric Vehicle market to uncover insights that can help EV companies strategize their sales and expansion plan better.


## **Project Output**
This project's output is a notebook documenting the analysis process starting from business understanding to giving reccomendations. Not only that, I create an interactive dashboard in tableau to help viewers understand the uncovered insights easily.

## **Data**
The data used for this analysis is from "Electric Vehicle Population Data 2024", Kaggle. This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset was last updated in 2024, meaning the dataset highly relevant to the current time. The dataset contains 177,866 rows and 17 columns.

## **Method**
I used multiple data visualizatin techniques to show the insights uncovered in the analysis, such as bar charts and choropleth chart. For the descriptive insight, I used central tendency methods and dispersion tests. I also used confidence interval to calculate a reliable price range.

## **Stacks**
In the notebook, I used these following libraries to help my analysis:
- `Pandas` - For data preparation and analysis.
- `Numpy` - For calculations.
- `Scipy Stats` - For inferential Statistics.
- `Matplotlib.pyplot` - For data visualization.
- `Seaborn` - For data visualization.
- `Geopandas` - For choropleth chart.

For creating the dashboard, I used Tableau and published it on Tableau Public.
