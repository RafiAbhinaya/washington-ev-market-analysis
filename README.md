- base_msrp.csv - EV price used for reference in data cleaning.
- Washington_EV_Market_dashboard.twbx - Tableau Dashboard

## Problem Background
I am a data analyst of a big Electric Vehicle (EV) company. Within a one-year period, the company is planning to expand their EV sales to Washington State. This initiative will begin with an analysis of the EV market in the region to formulate an effective and targeted sales and expansion strategy. As the data analyst, I am tasked to conduct analysis on the Washington EV market to uncover key insights.

## Project Output
This project's output is an notebook documenting the analysis and an interactive dashboard in tableau.

## Data
The data used for this analysis is from "Electric Vehicle Population Data 2024", Kaggle. This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset was last updated in 2024, meaning the dataset highly relevant to the current time. The dataset contains 177,866 rows and 17 columns.

## Method
I used multiple data visualizatin techniques to show the insights uncovered in the analysis, such as bar charts and choropleth chart. For the descriptive insight, I used central tendency methods and dispersion tests. I also used confidence interval to calculate a reliable price range.

## Stacks
In the notebook, I used these following libraries to help my analysis:
- `Pandas` - For data preparation and analysis.
- `Numpy` - For calculations.
- `Scipy Stats` - For inferential Statistics.
- `Matplotlib.pyplot` - For data visualization.
- `Seaborn` - For data visualization.
- `Geopandas` - For choropleth chart.

For creating the dashboard, I used Tableau and published it on Tableau Public.
